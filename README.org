* SCURVY Introduction and Purpose
  SCURVY is the 
  - Summary of
  - CUrrently 
  - Viable
  - deliverY options
  for CodeQL workshops.

  The name pays homage to great acronyms like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_evaluation_and_review_technique][PERT]] and [[https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/report-of-foreign-bank-and-financial-accounts-fbar][FBAR]] that make dry subjects
  more memorable.

  Using a [[file:notes/existing.org::*Existing workshops in single large repository][single, large repository]] for CodeQL workshops has numerous drawbacks
  making it impractical in actual use[fn:1].

  The one benefit it provides, a table of contents, can easily be provided for the
  collection of [[file:notes/existing.org::*Existing workshops in separate repositories][workshops that exist separately]].

  This project is such a table of contents.  Beyond a simple listing, it also
  provides
  1. for each workshop, a list of concepts it covers
  2. a program-drawn map of how workshops fit together
  3. a simple way to add goals and connect them to each other and the workshop
     contents -- again via a program-drawn map
  4. a stepwise procedure to simplify these maps

  The goals can be chosen arbitrarily.  The procedure to simplify the maps is
  always the same, only the details change with the goals.

* Using this project
  On your desktop
  1. Clone this repository *or* download it as zip file.
  2. Open notes/existing.html
  3. Browse.

  *or* online.  The most relevant files:

  1. https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/hohn/SCURVY/blob/master/notes/existing.html
  2. https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/hohn/SCURVY/blob/master/notes/gall.svg
  3. https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/hohn/SCURVY/blob/master/notes/gallcp.svg
  4. By removing the content description nodes, we get the simplified graph

* Development Setup
  SCURVY uses https://networkx.org for graph manipulation, graphviz for drawing,
  and emacs for literate programming and document generation; it may use
  https://pyexpander.sourceforge.io/introduction.html in the future.

  First, install conda.  Then, use the following Python setup on mac as example.
  Adjust as needed for your platform.
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    cd ~/work-gh/scurvy/mac/arm64
    conda create  -p scurvy
    conda update -n base -c defaults conda
    conda activate scurvy/
    conda install jupyter numpy pip seaborn pygraphviz pyvis \
          jupyter-dash ipycytoscape

    cd ~/work-gh/scurvy/mac/arm64/scurvy
    conda activate .
    pip install pertdist networkx
  #+END_SRC

  "Install" for local development:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    conda activate ~/work-gh/scurvy/mac/arm64/scurvy
    cd ~/work-gh/scurvy
    pip install -e .
  #+END_SRC

  To work in jupyter notebook:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    conda activate ~/work-gh/scurvy/mac/arm64/scurvy
    cd ~/work-gh/scurvy
    jupyter notebook&
  #+END_SRC

  To work with the emacs org-mode documents requires some setup beyonds emacs.
  Follow [[https://sqrtminusone.xyz/posts/2021-05-01-org-python/]] for details.
